For my final senior project at UF I wanted to build something that had machine learning, embedded systems, and would be fun to interact with. I teamed up with my classmate [Mason Rawson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/masonrawson "Mason Rawson LinkedIn"), and we came up with the idea to make an autonomous turret. Specifically, we wanted to make one modeled after the turrets from the game portal.
