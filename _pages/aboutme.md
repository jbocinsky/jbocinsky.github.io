## Previous Work

James worked with Dr. Alina Zare as an Undergraduate and Graduate Research Assistant in the [Machine Learning and Sensing Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/machine-learning-sensing-lab/ "MLSL Site"). 

* In this role James developed machine learning algorithms. He focused his efforts on developing a multiple target multiple instance target signature learning algorithm (MT-MI-ACE/SMF) to detect buried landmines for the Army. To develop these algorithms, James worked with Electromagnetic Induction and Ground Penetrating Radar data.

James worked as an intern for [Harris Corporation](https://www.harris.com/ "harris.com") in 2016 and 2017. 

* At his first Harris internship, James developed message passing tools for the FAA. These tools were abstract, handling any type of message passed autonomously between airplanes and towers. He developed a Java threadpool executor to pass high throughput messages off to worker threads for processing.

## Education

James has a history of success as a student. He graduated high school as valedictorian with a 4.4 GPA. He then took his motivation and success to the University of Florida and in 2017 graduated Cum Laude with a 3.76 GPA. Finally, James passed his [M.S. thesis](http://www.jbocinsky.com/assets/images/publications/Thesis.pdf) defense and graduated with a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, focused on Machine Learning in 2019 with a 3.79 GPA.

While at UF, James was a go-getter by partaking in various activities such as:

* Inducting into Eta Kappa Nu (Computer Engineering Honor's Society). 

* Collaborating with peers at UF hackathons.

* Elected as an exec board member and player of the University of Florida club soccer program.

* Constructing and teaching a 12 class machine learning course.
