## About

James Bocinsky is a M.S. student studying Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. Specifically, James works in machine learning and robotic systems. He is passionate for problem solving and software development.


## Current Work

James works with Dr. Alina Zare in the [Machine Learning and Sensing Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/machine-learning-sensing-lab/ "MLSL Site") to develop algorithms. He focuses his efforts on developing a multiple instance target signature learning algorithm (MIACE/MISMF) to detect buried landmines for the Army. To develop these algorithms, James works with Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data.

## Previous Work

James worked as an intern for [Harris Corporation](https://www.harris.com/ "harris.com") in 2016 and 2017. 

* At his first internship, James developed message passing tools for the FAA. These tools were abstract, handling any type of message passed autonomously between airplanes and towers. He developed a Java threadpool executor to pass high throughput messages off to worker threads for processing.

* At his second internship, James worked on the [T7 robot](https://www.harris.com/solution/t7-multi-mission-robotic-system "harris.com") envisioned for EOD. He developed a complete multicast messaging protocol for their Hercules processors as well as the framework needed to support the onboard, smart battery CAN messages.

## Education

James has a history of success as a student. He graduated high school as valedictorian with a 4.4 GPA. He then took his motivation and success to UF and in 2017 graduated Cum Laude with a 3.76 GPA. 

While at UF, James has been a go-getter by partaking in various activities like:

* Inducting into Eta Kappa Nu (Computer Engineering Honor's Society). 

* Collaborating with peers at UF hackathons

* Elected as an exec board member of the University of Florida club soccer program

* Constructing and teaching a 6 week machine learning course. 

James is currently working towards a M.S. in Computer Engineering, focused on Machine Learning, and anticipates graduating in the Spring of 2019.
